#### `git clone https://github.com/jdfcitecky/po_go.git`
Rename the conf file.
#### `mv conf_template.yaml conf.yaml`
Modify the configuration. You can use any editor to do this step.
#### `vim conf.yaml`
+ Check the part of db, let host and password is correct in your machine.
+ The IP dail in docker should be 172.17.0.1
+ Change the password of mysql root.
Build docker image.
#### `sudo docker build . -t po_go`
Run the backend image.
#### `sudo docker run -p 4000:4000 -i -t -d po_go`

### Get frontend app
Clone the repository. You can create a directory for this projects first using `mkdir` and `cd` go into the directory.
#### `git clone https://github.com/jdfcitecky/portfolio_react_2022.git`
Modify the configuration. You can use any editor to do this step.
#### `vim .env`
+ Ensure REACT_APP_API_ADDRESS point to where your backend app run, the backend may run on `localhost:4000`.
+ Change the backend address to elastic ip, if you deploy on AWS.
Build docker image.
#### `sudo docker build . -t po_react`
Run the frontend image.
#### `sudo docker run -p 3000:3000 -i -t po_react`
+ Since some machine such as AWS do not have the server that react app use, if add `-d` flag, the app will hang at asking you to install the server. When it ask you to install, just type `y` and restart another terminal.

# Create an admin
Use GUI to do this, your forntend app may run at `localhost:3000`.

# Set database
Get into the mysql container terminal.
#### `sudo docker exec -it mysql-test bash`
Get into mysql command line.
#### `mysql -u root -p`
Use database.
#### `use po_go`
Let the member whoes id is 1 to be the admin, you can assign other member to be manager. But since the backend design, only the id=1 member can chat to everyone and everyone can only chat with the id=1 member.
#### `update members set is_manager=1 where id=1;`
Delete this record, or the admin cannot use chat room.
#### `delete from chat_room_aliases where id=2;`
